# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Pyber is a python based ride sharing company and I have just started working for them. They have gathered a lot of information about their rides throug the time. This information was provieded to me and I was asked to make an analysis on the fares, drivers and city types among other things. I created some charts and data frames which will help the company CEO understand the companys trends and help them take better decisions. I was finally asked to create a line chart of the rides through the year 2019 in order to have a more visual represetnation of their trends.

## Results:

After merging the two different databases that where provided by the company, I was able to create a data frame divided into the three city types containing very valuable information regarding the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. The data frame is the following:

By simply looking at this data frame we can rapidly identify that the urban cities are the ones with the most rides and drivers, but the average fare per driver and the average fare per ride is the lowest of all the type of cities. Meanwhile, rural cities are the ones with the least drivers and rides but their avarage fare per driver and ride is the gratest. 

With this information I also created a line graph in order to visualize the total fare by city type. With this graph it is easier to identify the trends within each type of city. This is the graph:

With this graph it is easy to identify that by the end of the month of February, there is a peak in the total fare in every city type. We can also see how big the actual diference is between the total fare between city types and how each city behaves throughout this months. 

## Summary:

After analyzing the data provided, I have come up with the follwing business recommendations:

1. Either create more routs or decrease the amount of drivers on urban cities. I recommend to consider both because the total number of urban drivers is grater than the total amount of rides, this would explain why the average fare per driver is lower on urban cities. Pyber may reduce their costs if they reduce the amount of drivers they have or they could expand the amount of routs there are in order to elevate the satisfaction level of their drivers. 
2. If Pyber wants to have a successful marketing campaign, they should launch their campaign on the lasts days of February since this is the time where the most people use the rides. This way the company will have more reach and a better impact with their campaigns. 
3. Cosndier traking milage in order to understand better the information. Urban city drivers have a smaller fare per ride but this might also be bacause the routs in this type of cities are samller. Witht this information data can be analized better and better decisions can be made by the company.
