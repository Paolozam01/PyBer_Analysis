# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

Pyber is a python based ride sharing company and I have just started working for them. They have gathered a lot of information about their rides throug the time. This information was provieded to me and I was asked to make an analysis on the fares, drivers and city types among other things. I created some charts and data frames which will help the company CEO understand the companys trends and help them take better decisions. I was finally asked to create a line chart of the rides through the year 2019 in order to have a more visual represetnation of their trends.
